### USB drive preparation

1.  Download the iso image of the Windows or GNU Linux operating system.
2.  From Activities we open the Disks utility: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#1.jpg" width="250" height="250" />
3.  There we are going to unmount the USB drive from the system: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#2.png" width="250" height="250" />
4.  Once disassembled, we will see the following: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#3.png" width="250" height="250" />
5.  We click on the pinion icon and in the displayed list we select "Format partition": 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#4.png" width="250" height="250" />
6.  We assign a name to the drive and select the FAT format: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#5.png" width="250" height="250" />
7.  We click Next and we will see this message: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#6.png" width="250" height="250" />
8.  We apply the changes by clicking on "Format": 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#7.png" width="250" height="250" />
9.  Once the process is finished we will see the format applied correctly: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#8.png" width="250" height="250" />
10.  We mount the USB by clicking on the playback sign: 
        <img alt="screenshot" src="./assets/images/screenshot#9.png" width="250" height="250" />
